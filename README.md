# 1984-poem
The source code for a python script-generate poem.

This script is designed to generate a 6 stanza poem using both pre-written lines and randomly selected words and phrases from George Orwell's/Eric Blair's novel "1984". The concept behind this is part satire and part an examination of how the sparse structure of poetry relates to internet opinions. The idea is that it satirizes individuals who cite "1984" to back up their political positions, while having never actually read the book or understanding it. Particularly the now widely memed phrase, "This is literally like 1984". For the sake of artistic integrity, I have also never read "1984". The poem is short in order to emulate brief, gung-ho political syllogisms one might find on social media platforms. The idea of poems using a few disconnected words to give room for interpretation feels similar to the way that we are usually interpreting online information in a disconnected and concise format.
